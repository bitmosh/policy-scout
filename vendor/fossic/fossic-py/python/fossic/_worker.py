Python-owned subscription worker thread.

The worker thread is created by Python's threading module so that
threading.local, contextvars, logging context, and Django thread-locals all
behave correctly.  Rust only produces events into a sync queue; the worker
reads them and invokes the callback on a stable, Python-owned thread.

See FOSSIC_V1_SPEC.md §4.2 — "Python-owned worker pattern".
